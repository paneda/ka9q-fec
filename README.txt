This is a clone from https://github.com/Opendigitalradio/ka9q-fec (https://github.com/Opendigitalradio/ka9q-fec.git)
but all original sources are moved to src/ directory.

When updating from the internet all upstream changes should auto merge with the local ones as long as no new files are added to the upstream. Then you need to move them manually.
